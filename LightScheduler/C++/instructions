Develop a light-scheduling feature of a home automation system.
The light-scheduling feature allows system users to schedule lights to turn on
and off at a specific time on a specific day. The operating system can wakup
the scheduler periodically to trigger the schedule look-up process.
Design and implement the light-scheduler such that it can be tested on the
host machine without having a real light controller and RTOS.
